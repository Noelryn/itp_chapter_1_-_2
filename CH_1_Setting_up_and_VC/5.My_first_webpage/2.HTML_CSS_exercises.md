In this exercise, we'll expand a little bit on the work we did in the previous sections. 

* Add a few more pages to the site you built in the previous section
* Add a nav bar with a few links to navigate around your site or to external sites
* Add a couple of paragraphs describing amazing things you'd like to share


Be a bit creative about how you organize your content on your pages and make use of as much HTML markups as you can (Paragraphs, Headers, Lists, Images, Videos, etc...)

* Useful reference: [HTML hex colors](http://htmlcolorcodes.com/)
* Extra credit: Install [Mui](https://www.muicss.com/) and use it on a new project (hint: you may want to remove `style.css` from your project first.) Mui is a CSS framework that comes with a ton of built-in styling. Read the documentation or watch the videos to understand how it works and how to use it in your project. We'll work more with this during the Bootcamp.
