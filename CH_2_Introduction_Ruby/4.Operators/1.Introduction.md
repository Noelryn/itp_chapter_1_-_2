In the tables in the next sections, we will list a number of operators in the Ruby language. Try them out in `irb` as you go along. You won't be able to memorize all of these, but you will definitely need every single one of them at some point during the Bootcamp. Bookmark this page or print it out as a reference. It's very important that you understand what all of these operators do. If one is confusing, make a note and come back and practice.

We assume that a and b are variables with the following values:

```
a = 20
b = 10
```
