Please keep on practising your Ruby skills by completing Codecademy's Learning Ruby exercises. 

Go to [Codecadamy's Ruby page](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby )

It is also good that you get familiar with the [Ruby Docs page](https://ruby-doc.org/). You will have much use of it later on in the course.
