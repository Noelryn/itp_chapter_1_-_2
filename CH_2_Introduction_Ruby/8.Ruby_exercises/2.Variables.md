1. Write a program called `name.rb` that asks the user to type in their name and then prints out a greeting message with their name included.

2. Write a program called `age.rb` that asks a user how old they are and then tells them how old they will be in 10, 20, 30 and 40 years. Below is the output for someone 20 years old.

3. Add another section onto `name.rb` that prints the name of the user 10 times. You must do this without explicitly writing the puts method 10 times in a row. Hint: you can use the `times` method to do something repeatedly.

4. Modify `name.rb` again so that it first asks the user for their first name, saves it into a variable, and then does the same for the last name. Then outputs their full name all at once.

5. Look at the following programs...

What does x print to the screen in each case? Do they both give errors? Are the errors different? Why?
