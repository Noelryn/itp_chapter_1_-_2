1. Given a hash of family members, with keys as the title and an array of names as the values, use Ruby's built-in [select method](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/Hash.html#method-i-select) to gather only immediate family members' names into a new array.

2. Look at Ruby's [merge method](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/Hash.html#method-i-merge). Notice that it has two versions. What is the difference between mergeand merge!? Write a program that uses both and illustrate the differences.


3. Using some of Ruby's built-in [Hash methods](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/Hash.html), write a program that loops through a hash and prints all of the keys. Then write a program that does the same thing except printing the values. Finally, write a program that prints both.


4. Given the following expression, how would you access the name of the person?

5. What method could you use to find out if a Hash contains a specific value in it? Write a program to demonstrate this use.


6. Given the array...

Write a program that prints out groups of words that are anagrams. Anagrams are words that have the same exact letters in them but in a different order. Your output should look something like this:

7. Given the following code...
![hashes](/static/hashes7.png)


What's the difference between the two hashes that were created?


8. If you see this error, what do you suspect is the most likely problem?

A. We're missing keys in an array variable.

B. There is no method called `keys` for Array objects.

C. `keys` is an Array object, but it hasn't been defined yet.

D. There's an array of strings, and we're trying to get the string `keys` out of the array, but it doesn't exist.
