Let's return to your `my_group.rb` program. I have a small challenge for you. I want you to iterate through the array of hashes you created in the previous exercise, and display information for each person on the screen. Something like this:

```
Thomas is a 44 years old man
Anna is a 38 years old woman
# and so on...
```


You are free to Google, stack overflow or whatever you need to do to find out how to do this, but I want you to know that the answer is right above in this chapter ;-). 


###### Happy coding!
