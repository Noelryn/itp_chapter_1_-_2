A Ruby program can, of course, be stored in a file. By convention, Ruby source files have the .rb file extension. In most editors, like VS Code, your code will automatically be color coded. That is very convenient.

Let's say you write a short Ruby script and save it in a file called `hello_world.rb`.

```ruby 
# hello_world.rb

names = ['Thomas', 'Kalle', 'Anders']
names.each do |name|
  puts "Hello #{name}"
end
```


What do you think this code will do? (Hint: puts will print onto the terminal). When you have a guess, run the file in your terminal:

```ruby
$ ruby hello_world.rb
Hello Thomas
Hello Kalle
Hello Anders
```
If you are in irb you can load this file with the load or require command:


`$ irb`
`2.2.0 :001 > load 'hello_world.rb'`
`Hello Thomas`
`Hello Kalle`
`Hello Anders`
` => true`
