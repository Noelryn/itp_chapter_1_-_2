Here's a simple exercise for you to try what we have covered in this section:

1. Create an array and store it in a variable called `my_group`
2. Create three hashes describing an individual and name them `person_1`, `person_2` and `person_3`. The hash should contain the following keys:
* `name`
* `gender`
* `age`
3. Add all people to your my_group array.
4. Do everything in IRB but also save it in a .rb file called `my_group.rb`. We'll be returning to this example later on.
