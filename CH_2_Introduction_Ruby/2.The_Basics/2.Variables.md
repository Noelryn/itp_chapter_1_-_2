Variables are labels for bits of data. We use them to store information so we can easily reference it. Variables can hold almost anything.

In irb write:

``` shell
2.2.2 :001 > name = "Sophie"
 => "Sophie"
2.2.2 :002 > occupation = "Coach"
 => "Coach"
2.2.2 :003 > age = 31
 => 31
 ```

`name`, `occupation` and `age` are variables and store the values we have assigned to them. You can try to use them by calling them in the irb-console:

``` shell 
2.2.2 :004 > name
 => "Sophie"
 ```
